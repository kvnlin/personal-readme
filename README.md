# My personal README
Hi! Below is my personal readme that acts as a guide to how I work and how I tend to work/communicate with others.

## My Goals
- Learning as much as I can
- Help in any way to achieve our team's goal(s)
- Spread knowledge amongst the team
- Helping others in any way to make their lives / work easier.
- Cleanup our Rails codebase

## Things you should know about me
I have a puppy with a lot of energy so you may hear/see her in the background of video calls every now and then, but I generally take her out for exercise before 9, after lunch around 12, and at 5 and am usually out for a bit around those times for walks (sometimes I'll hop up during a call to get her away from something but I always have my earbuds on so I can still hear/speak)

My fiance and I try to have our meals together so I try to spend my lunch away from my desk, but I'll usually move our lunch around to accomodate meetings.

I'm big into basketball, video games, and sneakers/leatherworking and I usually spend my time outside of work on one of those three things.

## What I Value


## The Day-To-Day
### Communication
My primary preferred method of communicating is slack. When I'm working I tend to close out of Slack since I have a habit of checking any new activity in my channels, but I always have my phone next to me so if someone messages me I'll see it and open the app back up. I'm also a big fan of just hopping on a video call. I tend to type as I think and sometimes it results in a jumble of text over slack that is not necessarily coherent, and I find that explaining over a call while receiving live feedback / discussion is sometimes the best way for me to express my ideas. I never expect an immediate response over Slack so don't feel pressured to have to drop something to respond to me.

### Work Style
I'm a big proponent of pair programming and heavily paired at most of my previous roles, but I also understand it's not always necessary/wanted and only really works if both parties buy into it. I often suggest pairing but definitely don't feel like you have to and feel free to say no knowing that I won't be offended, I definitely understand it doesn't work for everyone/everytime.
